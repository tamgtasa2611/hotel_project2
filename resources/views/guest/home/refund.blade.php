                        Our hotel company was founded in 2024 by the one and only Tam Nguyen, who has a passion
                        for hospitality and travel. He started with a small guesthouse in Hanoi, where they
                        offered comfortable rooms, friendly service, and authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Over the
                        years, they expanded their business to other cities and countries, always maintaining their
                        high standards of quality and customer satisfaction. Today, our hotel company has over 50
                        properties across Asia, Europe, and America, and we are proud to be one of the leading hotel
                        chains in the world.
